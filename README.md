# Roger's SableCC tools

Many of these tools will require modifications by hand to the import and package statements depending on where you save them.

- VIM stylesheet makes editing SableCC grammars [look like this](vimexample.html).
- Grammar HTML-izer for producing HTML versions of the BNF grammar, [like this one](simplec.html).
- Grammar LaTeX-izer for producing LaTeX versions of the BNF grammar, [like this one](bnf.pdf).
- Text AST Printer for producing text output of the abstract syntax tree, [like this](ASTPrinter.html)
- GUI AST Displayer for producing a Java JTree version of the AST ([like this example](ASTDisplay.jpg)).
